# yarn2-nodejs-ts

Latest getting started template for Yarn 2, NodeJS with TypeScript. I actively maintain this template.

# Welcome

I like to share my well developed Yarn 2 template with you. You can use it to kick-off your development and continuously improve your code structure.

# A short word about OSS

I love to share my code with other developers. I look forward to feedback. It gives me the opportunity to learn more and discuss other approaches.
